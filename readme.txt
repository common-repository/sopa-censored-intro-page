SOPA censured intro page helps you show your support for our right to information, with a touch of humor: a "Censured" splash page for 10 seconds before to reveal your site.

== Description ==

This is not a redirect. The time for measure support has past, but I'll update it later in case we need it again.
Your visitors will find a link to http://americancensorship.org/ to support the fight for our rights.

Similar to others, but this one doesn't call home :) and its design makes the point.
